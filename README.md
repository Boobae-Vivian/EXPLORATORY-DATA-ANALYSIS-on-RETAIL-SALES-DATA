# EXLORATORY-DATA-ANALYSIS-on-RETAIL-SALES-DATA
## INTRODUCTION
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's competitive retail industry, data-driven insights play a vital role in business growth and decision-making. This project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing 1,000 rows and 9 columns of retail sales data using Python. The primary objective is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and key insights that can help the retail business optimize sales, improve inventory management, and enhance overall performance.  
By leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, this analysis will involve data cleaning, visualization, and statistical exploration to identify key sales drivers and customer behavior trends. The findings from this study will provide actionable recommendations to support data-driven decision-making and business strategy improvements.
